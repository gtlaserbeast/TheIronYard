polymorphic relationships pass both a type and an id


class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :something-able, polymorphic: true
end

add type and id to comment
In your migrate, assign datatypes to be passed in



in rails console


car.find 6

c = _

"_" is whatever was last entered into the console


c.comments.new generates a new comment with type and id based on the previously defined variable 'c'

whitelisting parameters is called strong params in rails


create doctors 

doctors can be created on and off of patients/hospitals



bonus: implement a search function using custom methods
