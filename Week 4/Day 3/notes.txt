waterfall vs agile?

waterfall is hated by sally?

agile is good

waterfall is the traditional software/general design dev scheme
  -2 months 
    -building requirements, talking to clients, developing ideas. huge unwieldy document
  -2 months
    -designing. db diagrams, wireframes, logic routing
  -6 months
    -coding requirements and designs
  -2 months
    -testing. Testers are bad coders and all they can do is debug
  -recurse to coding then back to testing
  -12 months later the requirements have changed and it'd take 12 more months to redo everything



agile
  -prioritized requirements

  Sprint 2 weeks
    -after two weeks, check with client and get updated requirements
  Sprint 2 more weeks
    -recheck for updated requirements
    -end every sprint with "a potentially releasable product"
    -small and frequent updates are due to the implementation of agile throughout the dev world
    -2 weeks seems to be optimal, in sally's opinion

  Priorities and estimates
    -value tasks first
    -prioritize tasks and then develop an estimate for development for each task
    -Storypoints are how estimates are formed
      -complexity + time + difficulty + uncertainty = storypoints
      -value := 1..100, effort := 1..10
    - Priority = value / effort
    -CRUD drives storypoints rather well


Github
  -add
  -commit
  -push
  -branching
    -any spot in your project that hosts code. master is a branch
  -forks
    - Fork takes a repository and creates a branch into your repository
    -make changes and then create a pull request
  -merging
    -bringing together multiple branches
    - merge-conflicts are possible if two folks are working on the same file and try to comit the same file


fork from an online repo and then create a branch from the cloned repo
always leave the master branch working

git checkout -b <newbranchname>

git branch shows branches
git checkout <branchname> switches branches

git remote add upstream git@github.com:tiy-chs-q4-fee/demo-gitRepo.git

git pull upstream master
  -pull = fetch then commit
github workflow




sublime emmet package. get it!





Main repository will exist on :github.com/tiy-chs-q4-fee

- come up with a team name. your team's repository will be the name of your team
- each memeber must contriute to the main repository
- each member must contribute to the main repository
- each member's work will be on a fork and submitted to the main repo via a pull request
- you are not allowed to merge your own pull request, another member on the team needs to do a code reivew and make comments. if changes are needed another member will perform the merge
- all work contributing to the main repo will be in the feature/fix branch, meaning your main repository will be working at all times
- the group project can be anything. it must not only have some design to it, but will be a fully functioning application
